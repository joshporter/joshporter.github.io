Just wanted to get something up and running.

Using the fantastic [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) theme by Mark Otto. Should definitely check it out. It was very easy to pull down, and make a few changes.

I hope to be posting all things PHP or Magento and anything else that I want to share.

Thanks
